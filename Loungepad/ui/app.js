 * underneath the moment a menu is dismissed, not after its fade, and a click cannot land on a
 * card that is on its way out. The stylesheet holds the animations; this only sets the classes
 * and takes .closing off again when the exit has run.
 *
 * How long that is comes from the stylesheet itself -- the longest animation on the element or
 * its direct children, delay included -- so a theme that lengthens a card's exit is not cut off
 * by the wash's, and with animations off (every duration 0) the class comes off at once, in the

/* ============================== trailers ==============================
   The focused game's trailer, played once the highlight has rested on it.

   Two surfaces, one clock. On the library the film goes into #backdrop, over the still art, after
   TRAILER_START_MS of the highlight sitting on one game -- but only under a theme that allows it
   (`--trailers` on #backdrop, none by default: Shelf's library stays as it was). The game's page
   has a player of its own under its shades, unless the theme draws the page over the backdrop and
   says so with `--trailer-surface: backdrop` on #screen-detail (Loungepad does): then the page is
   just another view of the same #backdrop film, which never stops, and the change of screen is
   the content crossfading over it. That is the only way to get a transition with no restart at
   all -- a <video> cannot change parents without a hiccup and an iframe cannot change them at all.

   Two kinds of source, one player. Steam's trailer is a plain mp4 URL: streamed from the store the
   first time, asked to be cached at the same moment (cacheTrailer), and played off disk once
   trailerCached has arrived; a cached file that fails to load -- evicted under us -- falls back to
   the stream, once. IGDB's is a YouTube id, because IGDB keeps no files, so it plays through
   YouTube's embedded player, chromeless, and is never cached. The URL says which it is.

   A theme that does not want the library film in some state writes `--trailers: none` on
   #backdrop, and the property is read here before every start. A menu over the library -- Y, the
   filter, the collection and manage sheets, a confirm -- leaves the film running underneath: it is
   what the menu is about. Typing a search, the Mods screen, the guide, a game running and the
   window being hidden stop it. syncTrailers is the one decision point and it is idempotent on
   purpose: every focus repaint and every screen change calls it.

   Nothing loops. A trailer ends on its title card and the still comes back; a screen restarting
   the same fifteen seconds is a screensaver, not a library. Moving away and back plays it again. */
