/*
 * The first-run setup: what a new install opens on, over the library, before anything else.
 *
 * A handful of steps, each a few of Settings' own rows -- the same builders, so a switch here is
 * the switch there -- with the scan that started on `ready` carrying on underneath. The rail on
 * the left says where you are and what has been found so far: the host reports the scan source by
 * source (scanProgress; see BeginSteps in UiBridge), and the library fills in behind the box as it
 * goes. The Look step moves the box aside, because the library behind it is the preview.
 *
 * Nothing waits and nothing is asked twice: every answer is saved as it is given (scheduleSave),
 * so quitting halfway loses nothing, and Skip leaves every default as it was. Finishing or
 * skipping stamps settings.onboardingVersion. A later setup with steps worth showing to existing
 * installs raises ONBOARDING_VERSION, and it shows again once. Settings → General → First-time
 * setup runs it again at any time.
 *
 * Two steps only appear when there is something for them: Playnite when it has a library on this
 * PC, Vortex when it is installed. The host's `onboarding` answer (ProbeFirstRunAsync) says which,
 * a moment after the setup opens -- while the welcome is still up.
 *
 * Loaded last. onboardState is declared in app.js, which reads it while it boots.
